Redux, React-Router, Firebase

useEffect is a very powerful hook which runs in a specific condition, It's gonna run only once when the component loads if it has array argument otherwise its gonna run everytime if it doesn't has the array comp. Anything we use within dispatch has to be imported in order to use it as a dependency, say we imported dispatch in our case. So this entire thing was about persistence of the component.

dependencies
npm i @material-ui/core @material-ui/icons react-router-dom

Reducer
its an action to trigger state and action is basically to 
trigger state

Dispatch is basically a very powerful function to dispatch an 
action called login in our case. Payload is gonna be the user
information like password email name etc.. 

This approach is basically used to prevent prop draining,
User Slice is basically like a data layerer
